- sfc_polygon (when does terra play well with sf?)
- better explain st_union
- make all data available somewhere
- remove the worldclim data thing that is way too big
- add a raster exercice
- exercice can be slightly more complex
- reduce the number of different datasets and the different naming schemes
- Better explain exercice 5 with climate niche concept better explain. Say we want a histogram.
- tall about the different sf class
- talk about the SpatRaster and SpatVector class


# spatialR
Course on using R for spatial tasks

###Overview of spatial data in R

- More and earlier and easier exercices. Need something that focuses on projections and something on simple spatial operations.

- Simplify code and possibly remove loops

- Comment everything

- Better explain the writeOGR part

- Better explain to which packages the different functions belong. Maybe list the different functions used to get some Data (occ_search, getData, etc.)

- Maybe better position the part about building a SpatialPolygons and refer to the help file

- Better explain pipes with an example

- Maybe explain the structure of spatial objects earlier

- Explain that spatial objects can be indexed just like matrices and data.frames

- Better explain the argument width in gBuffer with an example for latlon and projected coordinates

- Maybe put the over as the first operation in a simple case and show the output and then use it in the more complex example

- Better explain and compare the use of epsg in projections

- Simplify the bicknell example by removing the NA part and plotting the shp over the raster

- Explain stacks vs bricks

- Find a better example of rasterizing a polygon

- Exemple with sf and the tidyverse

- clean the mapping part and talk about OpenStreetMap

- Add an exercice of map creation with an interactively made polygon

- Complex examples should be numbered and better explained at each steps
